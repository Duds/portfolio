# Layout Component Standards

## Shared Expectations
- Accept `frontmatter` props
- Use `<Head>` to populate `<title>`, `meta` from props
- Render content via `<slot />`
- Include global `Header` and `Footer` components
- Avoid logic in layout â€” layout is structure only

## ArticleLayout
- Use article landmark tag
- Show title, date, author
- Include optional cover image at top
- Use `prose` class from Tailwind Typography

## CaseStudyLayout
- Use semantic sections: challenge, solution, process, outcomes
- Optionally include callout boxes
- Use grid or multi-column layout if needed
- Results can be rendered as a `<ul>`

## ScratchLayout
- Show title, date, and tag list
- Allow flexible embedded media (canvas, iframe, images)
- Use `prose` for narrative content
- Allow full-width sections for interactive sketches
