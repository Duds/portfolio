## Challenge

For government agencies, giving permits and authorisations can be a complex process. Many agencies are now subject to the requirement to make decisions based on the character of a person or business and their associates. There is no definitive standard on what constitutes a fit and proper person, with varying standards defined in legislation.

One government agency struggled with its Fit and Proper Person (FPP) research. There were significant delays while waiting for information, and much of the research required google searching (open source intelligence) and human investigative nous. They wanted to streamline their approach to FPP research and create a systematised FPP application and service that:

- Relied less on individual investigative judgement and experience
- Focused more on collaborative teamwork
- Reduced risks of missing changes in entity relationships

## Solution

### Technical Implementation

The Entity Active Management (EAM) platform was developed using:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 as the core platform
- Azure PaaS services for scalability
- Azure Cognitive Services for AI capabilities
- Azure Machine Learning for predictive analytics
- SQL Analytics Services for data processing

### Key Features

The platform provides:

- Real-time monitoring of governed entity relationships
- Financial, governance and media notifications monitoring
- AI-assisted decision making for entity assessment
- Risk identification and management tools
- Insights into relationship changes and patterns

## Process

1. **Service Design**

   - Developed detailed user stories
   - Created comprehensive service blueprints
   - Designed platform architecture
   - Established system configurations

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**

   - Worked closely with client teams
   - Gathered detailed requirements
   - Validated design decisions
   - Ensured alignment with business needs

3. **Agile Development**
   - Delivered in two three-week sprints
   - Maintained continuous stakeholder feedback
   - Adapted to changing requirements
   - Ensured quality through iterations

## Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits

1. **Efficient Processing**

   - Reduced delays in information gathering
   - Streamlined research processes
   - Improved decision-making accuracy

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Near real-time entity relationship tracking
   - Automated risk assessment
   - Proactive issue identification

### Long-term Impact

1. **Risk Reduction**

   - Better identification of high-risk entities
   - Improved monitoring of relationship changes
   - Enhanced ability to prevent criminal activities

2. **Enterprise Value**
   - Platform reuse across business units
   - Cost reduction through standardisation
   - Improved cross-department collaboration

## Key Learnings

1. **Process Automation**

   - Balance between automated and human decision-making
   - Importance of real-time monitoring
   - Value of AI in risk assessment

2. **Stakeholder Management**

   - Clear communication channels
   - Regular feedback loops
   - Alignment with business objectives

3. **Platform Design**
   - Scalability considerations
   - Integration requirements
   - Future expansion capabilities

## Conclusion

The EAM project demonstrates how modern technology can transform complex regulatory processes. By combining AI, real-time monitoring, and collaborative workflows, we created a solution that not only improved the efficiency of FPP assessments but also enhanced their accuracy and reliability. The platform's success in identifying high-risk entities and providing actionable insights has set a new standard for regulatory compliance tools in government agencies.
