## Challenge

An Australian Government Agency was facing challenges in verifying whether their field inspection procedures and processes were being followed effectively. They needed a modern, digital solution that could:

- Support national security activities
- Enable trade and border control verification
- Manage sovereign risk
- Handle incident management effectively
- Ensure quality outcomes in field inspections

## Solution

We developed a comprehensive verification service application with the following components:

### Service Design

- Created a detailed service model
- Developed a structured delivery approach
- Documented business requirements
- Established a service implementation roadmap

### Technical Implementation

- Built on Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform
- Integrated Azure cognitive services
- Developed PowerApps canvas field tool for inspectors
- Ensured secure and scalable architecture

### Key Features

- Dynamic verification platform
- Scalable architecture
- Enhanced security measures
- Support for field inspections
- Integration with existing systems

## Implementation Process

The project followed an agile development approach:

1. Initial service design and planning
2. Development of technical architecture
3. Implementation with development partner
