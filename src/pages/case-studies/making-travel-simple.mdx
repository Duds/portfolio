## Challenge

For academics and the higher education sector, travel is a part of life. Whether performing fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, presenting research findings in Toronto, or collaborating with co-authors in Edinburgh, travel is essential for international academic engagement.

However, the existing travel system faced several challenges:

- Bureaucratic and risky processes
- Inconsistent approaches to travel management
- Limited visibility of traveller locations
- Difficulty in emergency response
- Complex expense reconciliation
- Challenges in maintaining legislative compliance

## Collaborative Solution Development

### Research and Discovery

1. **User Research**

   - Conducted extensive stakeholder interviews
   - Mapped existing processes
   - Identified pain points and opportunities

2. **Service Blueprint Creation**

   - Documented end-to-end service interactions
   - Mapped touchpoints across departments
   - Identified system integrations needed

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Created user personas
   - Established relationships between roles
   - Developed support networks

## Core Principles

Adopted three key principles inspired by ethics reform:

1. **Replace**

   - Evaluate travel necessity
   - Consider digital alternatives
   - Explore local collaboration options

2. **Reduce**

   - Optimise travel frequency
   - Combine trip purposes
   - Maximise travel efficiency

3. **Refine**
   - Enhance trip planning
   - Ensure clear benefits
   - Measure outcomes
