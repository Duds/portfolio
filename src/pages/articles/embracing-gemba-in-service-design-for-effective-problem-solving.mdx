# Embracing Gemba in Service Design for Effective Problem Solving

## The Gemba Method

The Gemba method involves observing and understanding the working environment using facts and intuition. This systematic approach to problem-solving fosters a culture of continuous improvement and collaborative problem-solving. By focusing on people, their processes, and their work, the Gemba method helps identify issues and opportunities in real time and encourages solutions that involve those affected by the problems.

## Gemba Walks

The Gemba walk is a vital component of the Gemba method, where one observes work directly rather than relying on documentation or reports. The walk may occur without the team's knowledge, but engaging and enrolling people can lead to deeper insights into their thoughts, feelings, and actions.

During a Gemba walk, observe the work environment and employees' interactions, taking notes on factual observations and using intuition to evaluate the situation. Maintaining a neutral stance and encouraging team members to contribute their perspectives is essential.

> Go to the Gemba first. The best improvement ideas will come from observation and understanding the real work being done.

Taiichi Ohno, the father of Lean Manufacturing.

## Benefits of Gemba Walks

Regularly conducting Gemba walks can lead to a multitude of benefits for your organisation:

1. **Building a culture of continuous improvement:** By consistently identifying and addressing areas for improvement, employees become accustomed to seeking ways to enhance their work processes and overall efficiency.
2. **Developing trust between employees and management:** Gemba walks foster open communication and active listening, which helps establish trust between team members and management.
3. **Increasing employee engagement:** Involving employees in the problem-solving process empowers them to contribute their ideas, promoting a sense of ownership and investment in the organization's success.
4. **Improving collaboration across teams:** Gemba walks provide opportunities for employees from different departments to understand the entire process, fostering cross-functional collaboration and a broader understanding of the organization's operations.
5. **Supporting capability development:** By engaging employees in discussions about their work and the challenges they face, Gemba walks create opportunities for learning and skill development in areas such as conflict management, navigating difficult situations, and identifying solutions.
6. **Enhancing problem-solving abilities:** As employees gain insights into the root causes of issues during Gemba walks, they become more adept at solving problems and implementing effective solutions.
7. **Promoting innovation:** By understanding the intricacies of processes, employees are better equipped to identify new and innovative ways to enhance the organization's operations and services.

## Questions to Ask During a Gemba Walk

As a designer, it is crucial to understand the processes and challenges workers face. Some questions to ask during a Gemba walk include:

- Where do people start using or supplying the service?
- What problems do people have before seeking service?
- What influences people to use the service?
- What do people need from the service?
- What do people want to do in the service? What did the people like/dislike?

## Showing Respect During Gemba Walks

To gain the most from a Gemba walk, it is essential to approach the process with empathy and respect. Listen, think, analyze, and ask questions while offering suggestions based on your knowledge. By understanding and addressing employees' concerns, you can build trust and solve problems more effectively.

## Implementing Gemba in Service Design

By incorporating the Gemba method in service design, you can gain a deeper understanding of the customers, suppliers, and service delivery process. Emphasizing the service process allows you to fully grasp every nuance along the way, resulting in better-designed experiences for your customers.

When applied to service design, Gemba helps:

- Provide business solutions to problems
