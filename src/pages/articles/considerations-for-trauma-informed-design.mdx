As service designers, we aim to create effective and meaningful experiences for the people we serve. In particular, those who have experienced trauma in their life journeys can be especially vulnerable when engaging with services. This article explores how trauma-informed service design can help us provide better community services tailored to these individuals' needs.

> "Trauma is perhaps the most avoided, ignored, belittled, denied, untreated, and misunderstood cause of human suffering." - Peter Levine

## Life Journey Events in Service Design

When it comes to service design for life journeys, several organisations demonstrate the value and effectiveness of this approach:

### Canadian Health Services Example

- Implemented 'Life Journey Mapping' in Nunavut province
- Maps individual patient experiences over time
- Tailors services to meet specific needs
- Focuses on personalised healthcare delivery

### Scottish Social Work Example

- Uses Life Story Work with young people
- Supports transition into adulthood
- Helps understand impact of past events
- Influences present decisions and future outcomes

## Understanding Trauma's Impact on Service Design

A trauma-informed approach is essential when designing services for vulnerable populations. This approach:

- Strives to meet needs of trauma survivors
- Understands how experiences shape circumstances
- Creates meaningful connections
- Provides sophisticated support systems

> "Becoming trauma-informed is a radical act and an evolutionary practice. This is a commitment and means a shift in your training, new ways of doing and being, and embodying a deeper sense of purpose that ethically and responsibly works to understand the whole person you are designing with, for, and from. It's relational work â€” not transactional and extractive." - Rachael Dietkus, LCSW
